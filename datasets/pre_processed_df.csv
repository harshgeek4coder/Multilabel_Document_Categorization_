I entered my registration and was shown the tyres that were supposedly suitable for my car. I was looking for the same Bridgestone S001 run flat tyres. The S001 tyres appeared at the top of the search results and seemed a good price. I ordered them. Instantly I got an email from [REDACTED] saying they think I have ordered the wrong tyres and they ones I ordered were non run flats and my car would have run flats. Looking at the website again the correct tyres were 4 pages down in the search results and a total of £65 more expensive. Clearly the system knew at the time of checkout that I had potentially the wrong tyres as I got an automated email from them only once I had placed an order!! Trapped why not ask at the time of checkout!!! Had to pay the extra money which then took the total price to more than other quotes I had received.Then onto the fitting. The garage is only a few mins from my house. Booked for 8am on a Saturday. Arrived 7:50am. It then took 1 hour 45 mins to fit 2 tyres. Not impressed. Then when I drove away after that long wait my car warned me that the pressure in the drivers rear tyre was too low. It had about 10 psi less than the rest! So either the garage did not put enough in or the tyre was leaking air. Went back to the garage to get it checked out. No leak just not enough air put in (very dangerous). Drove away a second time to see that this time the same tyre still did not have enough air in it to match the rest of the tyres. I ended up going to a petrol garage and fixing the issue myself with the air pump. Small point also was that my alloys and tyres were absolutely covered in the white tyre lub. You expect some but the alloy was smothered in it. So had to take the car to the cleaners also.So in summary questionable buying process and a terrible fitting experience.,delivery punctuality

However, I made a massive mistake in choosing McConechy's, Sighthill, Edinburgh as the nominated tyre fitters. It is clear that as a [REDACTED] customer and not an actual McConechy's customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted, you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way.McConechy's fitted my tyres (although I'm very sure reluctantly).Upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go, I walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted. I then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork.A day later I was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that McConechy's had not even changed the valve stems either. I contacted McConechy's about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone. I told him that I noticed they had not changed the valve stems. I got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think I would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted, so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated ""but I changed the valve cores though"".I don't believe a word of that, what the tyre fitter guy doesn't know, is that I'm a fully qualified engineer and I know corner cutting when I see it. Remember I had to actually request that they fit dustcaps. Unfortunately I didn't notice McConechy's had not changed the valve stems at that time or I would have pulled them up right there and then.I know why he didn't change the valve stems, it is because they are all rusted up, badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over, maybe even some other problems that's why they were not changed and not his BS story about them being metal.I paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted. That is not what I got.I got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that I don't believe about the valve cores being changed.But that makes it OK doesn't it ? NO, it certainly doesn't !I was also supposed to have a free wheel alignment check done, the McConechy's fitter never made any mention of this. I had already decided not to go ahead with the alignment check anyway.Also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm. Well when I checked them 50 miles later, the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels, the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far.I do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place, more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun. There is no way the wheel nuts seen a torque wrench. The McConechy's tyre fitter was/is a story telling corner cutter. Avoid them, you are not a McConechy's customer, you are an annoyance to them, you are getting in their way. Not at all happy with any of this.Steven Dryden.",delivery punctuality

I was thinking of removing the run flat tyres from our F31 330d for many reasons but this was a job for the future...... until on my way home from work 2 days before we went on Holiday to France I picked up a puncture. The annoying thing was, the tyres x 4 had loads of life left on them so I had to bite the bullet and change all 4. [REDACTED] were amazing, they were quick and professional even to the point where they had realised that I had ordered non runflat tyres and sent me a warning Email in case I was not aware of my error. The tyres were delivered the next day to the garage of my choice in Lincoln. F1 Autocentres even managed to get the car in a day early so as we could be on our way to Holiday on time. Overall I would highly recommend this service to anyone. Not only for the swift professional dispatch of the order but the amount of money we saved compared to using other well known suppliers.

Secondly, the available locations were confusing, as there were multiple locations for the same business (Charles Hurst). Having chosen one, when I went to the business on the day, no one seemed to be aware of my booking - either in the chosen location, or in the second location I was sent to. Only the tyre that I had ordered (which turned up at the second location without any mention of a booking) led to the staff at the second location being aware of the booking, and so they were able to carry out the tyre change.

Tuesday evening came an email at 17.31 saying there had been a delay on the tyre and they needed to reschedule to Friday. This was no good to us as we needed it fitting Thursday at the latest due to a long drive. The option to call them straight away wasn't there, as their offices close at 17.30 coincidentally! Called them first thing Wednesday AM, my partner stressed that a fitting for Friday was not possible and Thursday would be the latest we could have it done.After speaking to the woman on the phone for 10 minutes and a few back and forth phone calls later, she agreed to have a fitter come out and fit the tyre on Thursday (AM) email confirmation received stating AM delivey/fitting.Thursday 11:30am and the fitter still hadn't arrived. My partner rang [REDACTED] and she said that an AM booking is anywhere between 9AM &1PM. 1:30PM and the fitter still hadn't arrived.

They were also able to undertake 4 wheel alignment at 1/2 the price of my local small specialist Mercedes garage (not even the main dealer). The price was as good as any of the other online supplers. As I often find Y rated Dunlops were cheaper than W rated tyres. Perfectly legal to fitted higher rated tyres than minimum requirement. These were also MO fitment tyres",location

I needed tires fitted at the weekend as mine were severely worn according to my MOT and I had a number of journeys to make with some pretty appalling weather forecaster. A friend suggested I check out [REDACTED], the prices looked great and a good range of local garages (5 within 6 miles or so of me) so I went ahead and placed an order. The following day (Friday) I received an email from them saying they couldn't book me in on the Saturday at my chosen garage and the next available slot was the following Monday. I replied and asked them to look at other garages in the area as I needed them fitted that weekend. About an hour later I received a follow up email telling me it was too late for them to deliver the tires to any other garage for the following afternoon and that the next available appointment was now Wednesday! I asked for my money to be refunded and figured I would just book myself in with a local garage instead as they had plenty of spaces to do the fitting when i needed it. Heard nothing back and no refund which meant I couldn't book in at the local garage instead. Followed up on the Monday to the customer service department and again heard nothing back. I ended up having to send an email to a different department, along with a complaint which resulted in my payment being refunded. No apology for the inconvenience or anything like that and then a follow up email asking me to review my conversation with someone I had never spoken with. I presume all the good reviews on here are people who haven't had an issue and everything has gone smoothly and all power to them, just beware that if something does go wrong with your order it seems you're stuffed trying to sort it out.",location

I chose your premium fitter in Basingstoke, Formula One Auto - and they were awful. Their customer service was non existent. I phoned up and got a quote for having the wheels tracked, they quoted £36 for front and £52 for front and back if needed, but I probably only had the fronts that it was possible to do. With this I sent my husband to have the tyres fitted, so when they charged him £48 he paid assuming it had been front and back that needed. They took nearly 23 hours from our apointment to fit the tyres, way longer than it should have for 4 tyres. I phoned them and said that the paperwork clearly stated only the front had been balanced and was given a wishy washy excuse for the over charge, which, because I know about cars I knew to be rubbish, he then said that they couldn't refund the over charge directly and needed to have a cheque sent to me, which I would get in a week. I then discovered the next day when I took the car out for a drive that they had under inflated all of the tyres by 5 to 7 psi. After 10 days I phoned back and advised the regional manager who answered the phone at the branch about the under inlfation and that the cheque had not arrived. I was promised a call back, which never came. A week later I chased again, again promised a call back and again did not hear from them. A few days later I called again and got the regional manager again who promised a call back, but still did not call. a few days later I eventually got the cheque refund through. The tyres themselves are good, but the company who represents you for fitting is by far one of the worse and clearly try to take advantage of people who they think know nothing about cars. Thankfully although my husband doesn't I do, it is disgusting that they tried to take advantage and over charge people. So for that reason whilst I may still recommend [REDACTED] for tyres I would be very, very, very careful about who fits mine in the future and advise anyone else to be too.",delivery punctuality

This was my 1st experience in buying tyres online and I have to say I'm totally pleased that I chose [REDACTED].The process of comparing, choosing and reading up about the tyres in my size and price range is very helpful and simple to do. They have several top Brands and a large overall choice.And that also goes for choosing the garage and appointment time/date that suits me.You chose the garage and your chosen tyres will be there waiting for you when you arrive. Supply them the order number and abit of information like which tyres you want replacing etc and then sit back and they'll deal with everything. You can leave a review of the garage afterwards to help others decide.You can even copy the appointment info straight into the calendar which is a nice touch. The app links to mapping services to direct you to the garage.If the garage offers other services you can order these aswell, but if there's a charge then you will have to pay that direct to the garage while there.The customer service is 1st class over the phone and in web chat forms.The phone app was recommended to me and I'll certainly be recommending it to other people I know who can benefit from the service.Prices are competitive and I found them to be cheaper than the majority of the market and knowing that the price I pay includes fitting and VAT means I don't need to separately pay the garage aswell.If you don't require fitting then for a reduced price they will deliver the tyres straight to an alternative address.If you need to cancel your order for any reason then they don't question it or try to convince you not to. They simply issue a full refund. No pressure at all. Easy.My experience with [REDACTED] was excellent.

I got a call at 11.47 from the tyre fitters asking me for my pin so that could start the electric engine in my car to move it. It had not been moved from where I parked it At 12.30 I decided to go back down to the tyre fitters they were still in the process of fitting my tyres. My car was blocked by another car that had no wheels on it. I the had to wait for these wheels to be fitted. I finally got away about 1.30pm. I had asked for the best of the 2 tyres to be put into my boot. so that I could keep it for emergency puncture replacement. I got home it was not there. I had to go back again and waste another 10-20 minutes while they looked for my tyre.

Overall, I'm really chuffed with the product (4 x Michelin Pilot Sport 4's) and the job the premier partner (Strathclyde Autotune) carried out.However, the customer service experience at [REDACTED] left a lot to be desired after it came to light I was consistently given incorrect information by email, and later on the phone.To cut a long story short, [REDACTED] appear to book jobs and services for you on their own system without consulting the garage you choose and their schedule for that given day.I booked a tyre fitting for 4 new tyres and selected some additional services.I was never given an appointment time. Similarly, the services I selected were split across a Friday and a Monday.Not the end of the world..but the tyre fitting was scheduled for Friday and TPMS Sensor Valve Replacement was scheduled for the Monday.For me it made more sense to fit the sensors on Friday whilst the wheels are already coming off to fit the tyres?Anyway, I phoned to challenge this aspect and to double check why I wasn't given an appointment time.I was told adamantly that the garage operated on a first-come-first-serve basis and that they couldn't provide the additional services I asked for.I struggled to see the value in this system over scheduled appointments; but I went along with it as I had already paid for the tyres.Cut To: Me the next day getting up super early to be the first person in this first-come-first-serve queue.After arriving at the garage before the staff, I thought it was odd that no other people were rushing to get there first?Turns out that the garage has an appointment book, and [REDACTED] tell you it's first-come-first-serve, and split your services across a weekend for no other reason than to cause total inconvenience?The garage was great though!..

Their new suggested day wasn't convenient and I was beginning to feel messed around so I replied saying it was becoming slightly ridiculous now and that I'd have to make alternative arrangements so please cancel the order. Three days later and I still had not received a response or order cancellation from them. I sent an email suggesting rather sternly that they get their act together and cancel/refund my order.

The purchase and arrangement of 2 new tyres for fitting at a convenient local garage was good. The price was a noticeable saving, and the pre-arranged fitting time meant I was expected at the garage reception. So far so good, with full marks to [REDACTED] at this point. My question from this point on is: how come it took the garage over an hour and a quarter to actually fit the tyres ? Ok, they were diligent enough to check all the wheels before they started, and reported unusual tyre wear on the fronts - for which we agreed to check the alignment. But the alignment check and adjustment was only carried out after the aforementioned 1.25hrs, and trhe end result was a 2 hour visit. For 2 tyres. On a prearranged 1/2 hr slot. With 5 days notice. This to me is unacceptable - some people also have jobs to go to, and I wasn't anticipating this chunk of time taken out of my working day.If Red Bull's F1 team can do it in 1.88 seconds with half a lap's notice , how come a major national chain can be as slovenly as this ?

The tyres are great goodyears so can't really go wron [REDACTED] need to take more car when selecting garages to fit there tyres. The issues I have is with the garage who fitted the tyres david duthie motors peebles they have chipped, scratched and made gouges round the rims. When I contacted the garage ( David duthie motors ) peebles they said the alloys are corroded they do have small areas of corrosion and not the cause of the damage there are even Mark's on the centre of the wheel where it has been secured to the machine.I have myself been in the automotive trade for over 20 years and in my early days fitting tyres if I had damaged a customers alloys like they have mine I would have offered to repair them without question. I think its ridiculous a so called [REDACTED] authorised installer can treat a customer like this.

Generally satisfied with [REDACTED].Just 2 issues:- Once a fitting service is selected you are given a calendar to select the day and time. Having selected an early morning time for my convenience at the designated supplier i was contacted later and told the time selected wasnt available. That was less convenient.The supplier selected was the nearest & most convenient but they were a mainstream BMW garage and not a specialist tyre fitter. They were clearly more focused on their BMW customers and despite clear instructions fitted the replacement tyre on the wrong wheel. This was apologetically rectified but resulted in the fitting of one tyre taking 2 hours. Instead of being fitted and on my way by 9-00 am as originally planned it was gone 12-00 when the job was completed.,tyre quality

I had a very poor experience where it apparently took the garage 2 hours 10 minutes to change 4 tyres, and a very muddled experience from start to finish... they didn't have my paperwork, couldn't find my tyres, were questioning whether I was there on the right day, etc. and then the length of time to actually change the tyres, whilst mechanics floated aimlessly around the garage doing nothing. I took the time to write a detailed review of the garage on the [REDACTED] website, but that review hasn't been published weeks on, and the garage still has a 5 star rating, leading me to believe that [REDACTED] are trying to protect the reputation of their premier partner garages despite customer experiences.",wait time

As usual, I took a screen-shot of the 'Order confirmation' screen showing these details for my records. Shortly afterwards I received an email confirmation from [REDACTED] which indicated that I had ordered a BMW Run-flat version of the Dunlop SP Sport Maxx. I rang to query this and although the sales person was very pleasant he seemed unable to accept that I had not ordered the BMW Run-flat version. Even after I emailed a copy of my screen-shot and then cancelled the order he still insisted that their ordering screen and systems are quite clear and that I must have accidentally ordered the wrong tyre. (Sub-text; another stupid customer!)I have since re-run my attempt to order this tyre and I suggest that [REDACTED] may benefit from re-designing their ordering screen and de-bugging their 'Order Confirmation' screen. After you enter a tyre number (AND the vehicle that the tyre is for!), the order-screen offers a number of boxes in rows of three which feature various brands of that tyre size. The large, headline text of these boxes are the brand and the price then the classified name of the tyre (in my case 'Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT' followed by some generic (and therefore worthless) 4 and 5-star reviews. Between the 5-star review and the price is a narrow ruled-off area with one or more unexplained icons and logos. All the offered brands seem to have a tiny black car icon, presumably to indicate to the totally confused among us that the tyres are for a car rather than a bicycle or an airplane. Some of the tyres then have various car logos - BMW, Mercedes, Ferrari etc as well as 'Run Flat', and MO. There is no explanation as to whether there is something special about the Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT tyre with a BMW logo that makes it only suitable for a BMW, and how can that be anyway? And if it is, why do they offer it in response to an inquiry for a Mercedes tyre, which is one of the compulsory fields in the ordering screen? And if these symbols are critical to the correct ordering of a tyre specific to a particular vehicle then wouldn't it be sensible for them to be much larger and with their relevance explained?Then, having allowed customers to order a tyre specific to a particular vehicle, why doesn't the 'Order confirmation' screen include that fact? If I hadn't checked the confirmation email carefully I could have easily ended up with the wrong tyre on my car.So, if [REDACTED] want me to try them again they need to let me know that they have either amended these issues or explained why they don't need to.",delivery punctuality

I turn up, after getting a reminder of my booking via text I might add. The garage didn't have any fitters to do my tyres. They were sick. So I was a bit annoyed they couldn't have informed me before I left. But I don't blame them for people calling in sick. I was asked to come back on Sunday.So I turn up on Sunday @ 11am and since I didn't need the car I was happy to leave it there all day. Was told to come back at 4pm. I come back and they have not even started my car. I had to wait an hour for me car and the garage didn't do the tracking I had requested with it. The only positive, and why I gave 2 stars and not 1. Is they offered to do the tracking for free.Had to go back on Tuesday. I turn up on time as requested, but they are not ready, ask me to come back in 45 minutes. So I do that, have to wait around 30 minutes to get my car seen. At the end they only did the front tracking. So I had to go back again on Wednesday. This time I was seen within 20 minutes of arriving.But overall the service was not good. Having to go back 4 times just to have 2 tyres fitted and tracking. I will not be using that garage again.

I'd first tried making a booking with Kwik Fit mobile fittings, they rejected it halfway through the booking process but then charged me for it and it took a week to get my money back. The only other place I could find was [REDACTED].com - they were offering good sport tyres next day at a very reasonable price to be fitted at the local HiQ garage. It seemed too good to be true, HiQ themselves charged more money and couldn't do it till the next Tuesday yet [REDACTED] could get the tyres to them for the next day for a cheaper price. The reviews looked good so I took my chances and it was all smooth sailing. The appointment was first thing the next morning, tyres arrived no problem and by 10am the job was done. It does seem a very good service that puts the major tyre shops like National to shame who can only get tyres to their centres in 2-3 days, plus the price is very good, so I will certainly look to [REDACTED].com again in the future.",booking confusion

I shose the cheapest as it is only a spare and ordered it having chisel one of their premier fitters. The fitting time came through which was not convenient so called [REDACTED] who quickly rearranged the time for me.Turned up and immediately the wheel was taken, the new tyre fitted and balanced and then bought back to the car and put in the boot.

Unfortunately, no follow up the next day. An email sent to them.. and another one. Still no reply... - Right, looks like I will need to ring them, I thought. After 10 min of waiting finally managed to get through, but the line was so bad I was transferred to another call... 10 min... 15 min... no answer. I had to hang up and go back to work...I am selling my car and promised the guy I will put a new set of tyres on her... I know [REDACTED] doesn't care, but if they tell me they can get those fitted in two days and get good online reviews - well that's why I am buying from them and not elsewhere. I am kind of seriously stuck here because of them!***UPDATE***An email eventually came saying the tyres have been delivered and asking me if I had been aware of it and already had them fitted(???).... I replied saying noone let me know anything and I'm still awaiting for the appointment to be rescheduled. Guess what? No reply again. The next morning I decided I'm not going to deal with them via email any more, and just headed (without an appointment) to the garage in question and asked if they had received my tyres (they had). Explained what'd been going on and fortunately they kindly agreed to fit them for me. I'm not sure if this was just an isolated example of poor case handling by [REDACTED] or this is the way they treat their customers in general, should something go wrong.I normally don't have time for this sort of rubbish (unanswered emails, waiting in a phone queue for ages).

Got to tyre fitters and they said they could not get wheels off to change tyres due to stripped locking wheel but key. Said they couldn’t do it as they closed at 6pm and it was now 5:45pm. They requested I get lockers removed and then come back. I asked about making another appointment and they told me it would be an issue holding the tyres or getting them fitted when I got back.

Order placed on Monday at 11.55am for 2 tyres at over £400, promised delivery of Tuesday next day. I received an apologetic email and a voicemail outside of office hours at 5.35pm Monday, that stated the tyres would not arrive Tuesday but Wednesday instead. Contacted [REDACTED] on the phoneline on Thursday PM after realising that we had not yet had a delivery. The call handler explained that there had been a courier issue and that the tyres could not be supplied until the following Monday, 7 days after initial order. They were apologetic that I had not been contacted but couldn't offer an explanation as to why I was not informed that delivery would be delayed. Although the call handler was apologetic, it was explained that these tyres were for a client vehicle and had caused a delay in it being returned to the customer. I was offered 10% discount on next order, which I did not accept. As a gesture of goodwill it is lovely but doesn't help with the current issue & let down client. I have now sourced the tyres elsewhere, which have been delivered on Friday (today). It has taken 13mins on hold at peak time to cancel the order, (please change the on hold music :) !) but credit to both call handlers who chased the order, courier, and cancelled the order. Both very professional and did their best to assist. Just a shame that we haven't been looked after as a business in this instance",delivery punctuality

Unfortunately due to time commitments I was unable to reschedule my fitting and had to go ahead with the 2017 tyres.

Kia sorted out the tyre for a cost and passed the car and the garage who fitted the tyres reimbursed me for that cost.

I have recently had tyres fitted at Tweeddale Motors in Peebles, my second visit through [REDACTED] and they are absolutely fantastic! Friendly efficient and a pleasure to deal with. The reason for the poor rating is this, before my first visit to Tweeddale Motors I had arranged for a fitting in Penicuik. I went to get the tyres fitted and was told that [REDACTED] customers must leave the car for four hours after which the tyres will have been fitted ready for collection. I was unable to do this and said that I would have to return another day. Looking at the [REDACTED] website it stated that a queuing process would be in operation at this location, so I arrived at opening time a couple of days later, only to be told to collect the car in four hours time. Given the absence of customers and the information on the website I explained that I was unhappy with the service being offered and was told that if I did not wish to fit in with their procedure they would return the tyres which I agreed would probably be for the best. I spoke to [REDACTED] about this and, while very sympathetic and offering a discount on the price, they expressed no interest in including the fitting procedures in Penicuik on their website and indeed to this day it appears unchanged. I felt like a second class customer for using [REDACTED] in Penicuik, if the conditions were made plain on the website, I would have been able to make a different choice. Worse was the fact that [REDACTED] customer relations were not interested in addressing what I think is a real issue.Incidentally I did not bother with the discount as I was delighted with the service I received in Peebles.",booking confusion

Gave several places for the fitting service near me which was done as soon as we arrived & back on the road within 25 minutes. Only issue we had was that the tire pressure warning light was on after fitting. They said it will go out when I start driving but it did not. Stopped at a petrol station & found the new tires were well below the correct pressure. Perhaps if they are not sure of the pressure then they should ask the customer.

He then did the off side and immediately he put the wheel on the balancing machine, he said the wheel was buckled and there was nothing he could do.

The first appointment was missed as the tyres hadn't arrived in stock in time. This was very frustrating as I wanted the new tyres for a road trip I was taking to Scotland. We arranged to have the tyres fitted the following Saturday AM. At 11 o'clock that morning I received a call from the tyre fitters saying they hadn't received tyres from [REDACTED] (not true) and could they fit them tomorrow morning instead (Sunday). I said yes. The next day the tyre fitters didn't show up and I received no call whatsoever. I called them at around 4:45pm. They said they had broken down on the motorway and were going to call me that evening? I spoke to [REDACTED] who were deeply apologetic and arranged for the tyres to be fitted the following Saturday. I asked them not to use the same mobile tyre fitter as I didn't trust them but they did. The following Saturday arrived and once again, no one showed. I called [REDACTED] who called the tyre fitters. Once again the tyre fitters said they wouldn't be able to get to me and asked if they could come on Sunday again instead. Obviously I told them where to go. In the end we agreed that a local fitter to me would fit the tyres this Saturday. I went there and all appeared well. However when I collected the car some of the lacquer from two front wheels had been scuffed off! The tyre fitters came up with the reasons why but didn't actually apologise or accept blame. They said they will have a look at it this Friday. It's fair to say I have now given in. To be fair, throughout this whole situation, [REDACTED] customer service has actually been very good, especially from their call centre staff, and they have compensated me at each missed appointment. The problem is that there is a big issue with the tyre fitters they use/in general and I would not recommend whatsoever, having your tyres mobile fitted in the Leeds/Bradford area as this is the only mobile tyre fitter [REDACTED] use.",mobile fitter

Booking 4 new tyres for my Audi Q3 was easy and booked a time slot at their ‘recommended’ garage, so far so good.So turned up 15 mins before the due time as requested and walked in only to be greeted with “the car wash is outside”, after pointing out I was there for 4 new tyres was told “oh sorry” and asked for my name then to be told they were busy so there might be a delay. So not the greeting I would have expected and why give a time slot then not adhere to it?Anyway there were two other customers in front of me in the waiting room when the manager came out and told them both exactly the same thing, their tracking was out but it can be rectified for a special price of £38 (approx as can’t remember exactly). After the other customers had left the manager came out and gave me exactly the same pitch about the tracking, and the special price of £38 (I check my tyres regularly and had not seen any signs of uneven wear) so declined ......... call me a cynic but 3 people in a row all with exactly the same pitch about tracking? Seems unlikely to me and a way of getting another £38 out of people.So after approx 1hr 15 mins I left the garage all completed and apart from the above all seemed ok.Not using the car that much due to a few days off it was parked up. 4 days & less that 75 miles later I got a tyre presser alert and on checking found all the tyres had been over inflated 42psi instead of 36psi.Moving on to 6 days later and around 150 miles later noticed that the F/N/S wheel has a nut missing, the locking wheel nut was gone so checked the others & found the F/O/S wheel had 2 x nut covers missing and the locking nut was loose and could be turned with your fingers.I immediately went to the garage and to be fare they ordered a replacement set of locking nuts without much quibbling and 90 mins later went back for them to be replaced BUT as they were a patterned replacement the nut covers did not fit so now I have the 4 locking wheel nuts without covers and one of the standard nuts without a cover. The managed did say he would order a replacement set and then get them to fit but why should I settle for second bast. My car was in purse to condition when I went in for the tyres and due to their error has left me with non standard locking wheel nuts and covers missing - not happy!!Overall the whole experience with this garage is poor to say the least and I would never use them again.

However, I made a massive mistake in choosing McConechy's, Sighthill, Edinburgh as the nominated tyre fitters. It is clear that as a [REDACTED] customer and not an actual McConechy's customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted, you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way.McConechy's fitted my tyres (although I'm very sure reluctantly).Upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go, I walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted. I then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork.A day later I was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that McConechy's had not even changed the valve stems either. I contacted McConechy's about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone. I told him that I noticed they had not changed the valve stems. I got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think I would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted, so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated ""but I changed the valve cores though"".I don't believe a word of that, what the tyre fitter guy doesn't know, is that I'm a fully qualified engineer and I know corner cutting when I see it. Remember I had to actually request that they fit dustcaps. Unfortunately I didn't notice McConechy's had not changed the valve stems at that time or I would have pulled them up right there and then.I know why he didn't change the valve stems, it is because they are all rusted up, badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over, maybe even some other problems that's why they were not changed and not his BS story about them being metal.I paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted. That is not what I got.I got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that I don't believe about the valve cores being changed.But that makes it OK doesn't it ? NO, it certainly doesn't !Also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm. Well when I checked them 50 miles later, the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels, the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far.I do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place, more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun. There is no way the wheel nuts seen a toque wrench. The McConechy's tyre fitter was/is a story telling corner cutter. Avoid them, you are not a McConechy's customer, you are an annoyance to them, you are getting in their way. Not at all happy with any of this.Steven Dryden.",delivery punctuality

I gave him my keys, he said it would take around half an hour. 20 minutes later at 8:30 he phoned me to say he couldn’t find my locking nut, I explained where it was (in the tyre-change kit…not a particularly obtuse place for it to be located?), he still couldn’t find it. I went back to the car to show him where it was, he stated that he didn’t have time to rummage through people’s stuff. I submit that if he’d shown up on time he’d have had an extra 10-15 minutes to rummage through my stuff.

I’d had Bridgestones on my summer wheels for over 40,000 miles on the rears. I’ve been running Winter Wheels and tyres and when I had to get my summer wheels back on and the rears replaced, I tried [REDACTED] (BC). Having bought tyres online for the last 3 sets of tyres, I found BC to be the cheapest available for what is quite an unusual size. Add to this there was a 10% off flash sale that day and the price was considerably cheaper than TyreLeader. The wheels and tyres were fitted by a local tyre dealer I know. Unfortunately when I got home, I realised that one of the tyres was not a Mercedes Only(MO) tyre. The difference between the standard tyre and the MO is that the MO tyre has a significant 2cm flange that protects my lovely AMG 19in rims. I often say that you only know what a company is like until there is a problem. The resolution of the problem is the mark of how good the company is. BC went above and beyond:I contacted BC and they were fantastic. As I work in London, and I’m busy at the moment, it took me a little while to get round to taking photos for BC’s reference. However, despite having travelled over 700 miles since fitting, BC have arranged for the tyre to be replaced with the correct one. Additionally, BC gave me a generous goodwill gesture as recognition of my inconvenience. I will not only buy all my future tyres from them, but I will also highly recommend them to my family and friends. If all companies treated their customers with the efficiency, courtesy and genuine desire to provide a good service, as BC do, the world would be a better place! Well done [REDACTED] and thank you.",delivery punctuality

Details of the issues are below.- Arranged and paid for two new tyres to be fitted and 4-wheel alignment as rear tyres wearing on inside- Took time off work and waited at garage. Work done and was given paperwork. Wheels dirty - but as expected- Left for work and steering wheel off-centre when going straight- Got to work and checked values on paperwork. Rear out of alignment and before/after figures unchanged- Left work early and returned to garage. Told rear not adjustable and the only way to do it is to fit new parts- Arranged to bring car back next day to sort steering- Rang Audi to ask about part required etc. and was told that all settings ARE adjustable by any competent garage, both front AND rear- Went to another wheel alignment place and asked them to confirm. They put car on ramp and within 30 seconds said the same and they didn't even need any specialist tools etc.- Took more time off work to return to A&S as agreed. Told them my findings re adjustment and they said they would sort it along with the off-centre steering wheel- When finished told ""all done"" - given no paperwork. Asked for printout and once received checked it whilst there. Rear STILL not adjusted- Asked for an explanation. Wasn't given one but told I would need to bring it back AGAIN- I then went on ~100 mile journey on which someone almost drove into me. I checked the dash cam. Found out it had been moved to point at the sky. Reviewed the footage and it was an employee at A&S that moved it prior to taking the car for a drive - I can only assume he wanted to drive it like he stole it- Cleaned car at the weekend afterwards and the gunk that was on the wheels was actually all over - especially one. Was also stuck on like glue. Took some fairly abrasive wheel cleaner and a lot of effort to remove- Checked the pressures of the new tyres - they had been set too high - higher than the maximum load pressures indicated on the car itselfIn summary, DON’T use this garage if you value your vehicle, time, money or safety.",length of fitting

Chose Kumho’s as I’d bought a 2nd hand BMW with these on a few years ago and they seemed OK. Existing Avon (ZV-7’s(?)) only 20% worn / 2 years old, but showing extensive micro-cracking to sidewalls. (Incidentally: Seen this before on Avon’s put on the kids’ cars, so consequently wouldn’t touch these again).Responded to customer satisfaction email from [REDACTED] commenting that jobsheet disclosed that fitters has seriously over-torqued wheelnuts (140Nm vs. 110Nn), suggesting they might want to look at their QC/spec. on this. By the time I got a response, requesting a copy of the jobsheet, it had become clear that one of the fitted tyres was not holding pressure, so advised this additionally, when sending copy jobsheet Invited to return to fitting depot to rectify. Unfortunately, return visit was an absolute object lesson in how NOT to deal with a customer service issue, particularly in a business where the customers need to be assured of the professionalism of the service with which they are being provided, not least because it impacts directly on their safety.So:- (Manager) Don’t moan to me as soon as I arrive that you’ve “been dealing with nothing but problems all day!”. I don’t care. I just want you to do what should have done properly with my car in the first place.- (Fitter) Crack the wheel nuts off with the tyre on the ground, not against the auto gearbox-“Park”. This is car DIY, page 1. Unbelievable!- (Manager) Don’t tell me that “often old cars leak from the rims”, inferring there’s nothing to be done in that case. I drove more than a million miles a bought maybe a hundred tyres before you were even born sonny and know perfectly well that there will often be slight corrosion on the bead seat of even a very new alloy wheel, and this is capable of compromising the integrity of the air seal. Any tyre fitter who knows his salt will inspect the rim, note this, and, as necessary, wire brush or even file this smooth.- (Manager) When faced with my sceptical look about “leaky rims”, don’t then pathetically backtrack and suggest kerbing, or a pothole as the culprit (what, in the 20 miles since fitting?!) The rim was not inspected and properly prepared for fitting and that’s all there is to it. - (Fitter) Tighten the wheenuts down in a star pattern, not a circle. And do the same with each of the nuts. Just because there are 5, you don’t have to forget to torque down the 5th! I watched you! - (Fitter) Having been told the other wheel remains over-torqued to 140Nm where’s the spec is 110, don’t check it with your torque wrench set at 110Nm and then tell me it’s OK - you need to loosen the nuts off first and then do it again properly, to the correct torque! God Almighty!They’ve had their chance, and another, so suffice it to say I will not be darkening their doorstep again. It’s a shame, because their choice of tyres is good and sometimes you just need something respectable, mid-range, not ultra-premium, in a tyre. It would never happen, because their prices for the latter,e.g. Michelin, are higher than Costco, but theoretically I could have been going to [REDACTED] and spending £1200+ on 4 tyres for one of my other cars, not £150 on 2...
